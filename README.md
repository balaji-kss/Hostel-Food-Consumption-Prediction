# Hostel-Food-Consumption-Prediction
In order to reduce the wastage of cooked food, we implemented Kalman Filter algorithm on the previous hostel food consumption data to predict the amount of food required to cook for the next day. In order to get proper results, previous collected data has to be sufficient such
that covariance converges.
# Installation
System Identification Toolbox has to be installed in Matlab before using the code.
